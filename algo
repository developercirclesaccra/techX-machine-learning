An algorithm is a clearly specified set of simple instructions to be followed to solve a
problem. Once an algorithm is given for a problem and decided (somehow) to be correct,
an important step is to determine how much in the way of resources, such as time or space,
the algorithm will require. An algorithm that solves a problem but requires a year is hardly
of any use. Likewise, an algorithm that requires thousands of gigabytes of main memory is
not (currently) useful on most machines.
